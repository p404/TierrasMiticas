Public Release of .55i Test Version

We currently have available server versions for Windows (95, 98, 2000 and NT), Linux and FreeBSD.  

In this download the .INI is included, and you must configure this as it is specific to your server. Be sure to read bugs.txt and revisions.txt.  This download includes all scripts (also scripts\speech and scripts\test), an empty account file, a basic worldfile (with no errors on startup!), and basic web status page. First time Admins extracting the .55i file to c:\ with UO installed in C:\program files\Ultima Online\ will be able to get the server running without having to modify a single file.  (Normally you would have to add your account and others to the account file to log in -- and you will still have to point your login.cfg at the server, but you may add your admin account on the fly by typing ".account add Acctname Password" and ".account Acctname PLEVEL 7" from the console.

First time admins should familiarize themselves with our Newbie Checklist posted in the General Help forum of the Discussion area and refer to our newly expanded Help section.  You can get more help with your SPHEREserver in our IRC channel #sphereserver at irc.sphereserver.com.  

As with all test versions, veteran admins should install this test release to a NEW directory and should not upgrade a regular full time public server to this version without making a full and complete backup to your original scripts, worldfile and account files. As a test release, this all in one package includes worldfile and starter account file.  We still would ask people to wait to update their scripts -- at least until we have some conversion documentation available. (Please note, there is help available for conversion if you wish to do so, in our Help forums in the Discussion area, just search on the words: convert, conversion, 1.0 or new scripts. 

Be especially careful not to overwrite or accidentally delete your existing script, account and files if you wish to preserve them for conversion from older SPHEREserver versions.  Please also note that as an ALPHA TEST this server version's scripts may or may not be used in our upcoming 1.0 release.  The scripts included in this release appear to have been 'dumped' into the default directory, we're still in the process of organizing them.  The purpose of this?  Drop in scripts are now supported.  No more constantly updating a variety of files to add 1 item.  Just drop in a .scp file with the item and all its characteristics and away you go.  Client versions up to 3.0.0c are supported, as well as UO3D -- no 3rd party tools like Ignition are necessary.  Post any bugs you find in the bug board, and please use search first to see if your bug is already posted.
